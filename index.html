                               <p>Primarily, there are two reasons why we sometimes see the moon during the day. First of all, the moon is bright and close enough to be seen against the blue hue of the sky. Secondly, the duration for which it is above the horizon of Earth coincides with the sun, making it possible to be seen during the daytime.</p>

                            <p>Even though violet light is scattered too, there are a couple of reasons why we see the sky as more blue than purple, according to Ed Bloomer, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in the U.K. First, the sun doesn't produce equal illumination in all colors; it contains more blue light than violet light, so more blue light is scattered.</p>

                                <p>Some possibilities that have been considered are that humanity might be alone in the Universe, early to the party, or is not in a position to notice any yet. But in a recent study, Robin Hanson (creator of the Great Filter) and an interdisciplinary team offer a new model for determining when the aliens will get here. According to their study, humanity is early to the Universe and will meet others in 200 million to two billion years from now.</p>

                                        According to NASA, Earth's mass is 5.9722×1024 kilograms, or around 13.1 septillion pounds. This equates to around 13 quadrillion of Egypt's pyramid of Khafre, which itself weighs around 10 billion pounds (4.8 billion kilograms).</p>

                                        <p>Airplanes stay in the air because their wings generate lift as they move forward, and airplanes must move forward to maintain their lift. Or to put it another way, lift is an upward, vertical force that pushes against a plane’s weight and keeps it in the air.</p>
